# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# The for loop iterates from 1 to 20 checking if the variable i is equal to 20. If it is equal print out something.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# When i the iterator hits 20.
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# i is declared and used in the for loop.
